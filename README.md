### Summary
Bicycle navigation is tough, especially in an unfamiliar city. BikeIt helps you plan your bicycle trips more efficiently by using the MapBox Directions API which uses a combination of OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) and Open Street Maps and provides the user with turn-by-turn directions optimized for bicycles.

BikeIt also inspires people to live a more adventurous and healthy lifestyle through the discovery of new neighborhoods all while staying active on a bicycle. BikeIt has a social component where users can either create a new cycle group, or join an existing cycle group and bike together while exploring new neighborhoods in town.

### Benefits
* Turn-by-turn directions that are best for bicycling
* Motivational tool for people to live a healthier lifestyle both physically and emotionally
* Discover new neighborhoods in town
* Social aspect: platform for users to get outside and meet new people
